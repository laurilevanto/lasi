Re: Keeping mosaic pieces from seperating
Postby Gundula on Mon Apr 27, 2009 2:38 pm 
I make mosaic slabs by arranging the tiny bits of clear dichroic on thin black, to keep them in place I make a border about 1/2" wide of thin black strips and make sure the dichroic bits are nicely packed together, then I cover the whole slab, including the border, with thin clear and do a full fuse. 
I score and tap off the black border, cut and grind the pieces I need from the pure mosaic slab I now have, and fire the pieces again to finish.
