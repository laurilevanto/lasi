Laurin Lasisivut

This repo contains the web pages about warm glass work, produced by my late
father, Lauri Levanto.  The pages are visible at http://lauri.lsd.dk/ They
are mostly in Finnish, but there are sections in English and Swedish as well.

I put them up on GitHub to be sure they have a home if I ever have to stop 
hosting them.

The pages consist of html files with all the actual material, and php files
that serve only to include the various parts of the pages, most importantly
the page itself, a top bar, and menu on the left bar. Many have pictures on
the right column as well, etc.

GitHub can not show the pages in their current form. It would be nice if
someone took on the job to convert them to markdown, or some other format.
Unfortunately I do not have time for such project, there are over 200 pages.

If someone can set up a mirror of the pages, that would be cool too, for I am
not sure how long I can keep them up.
