what you are talking about is called watt loading, or watts per square inch of element wire surface area. There are 3 different standards depending on the element placement. Elements surrounding a mullite tube in the open air can handle the highest watt loads. Elements in a routed out channel in the brick must have less, and elements embedded in insulation can handle the least. Off the top of my head I remember the watt load for embedding needs to be less than 10 watts per square inch of surface area. The surface area is figured by multiplying circumference times length. I don't know the metric equivalents. Somewhere in my notes are the acceptable watt loads for the other conditions.
