  I have heard the rumor that using super glue (main ingredient cyanoacrylate) releases cyanide gas when used at high fusing temps. I spent some time with the chemists about this ingredient. The bottom line is something like this: It is theoretically possible to release cyanide gas at these temps. 
  What's happening with the glue is that the flash point is under 300 deg.
   Then it actually re-liquifies and eventually burns off. 
   However, 
   the Health and Safety dept for these companies agree that 
   it would take one hell of a lot of glue to even register..
   .given the conditions were true to create the environment in the first place.
    I told them I typically use 2 whole small tubes of glue for a kiln load. 
    I use it to hold pieces in place for handling. 
    That was no more than 6 grams. 
    They agreed that if there was any danger, it was minimal. 
    I really wanted the inside info on this,
     as I have had teachers use and teach its use in class, 
     and others that raised the caution flags.
      I would say to any newbie or any not-so-newbie 
      that you should use your own discretion.
       However, the "survey says" it's probably not a problem
        in the quantities that we work with.

  Interesting. Did some research on this when I started using superglue to hold small pieces in place in tack-fusing and found much the same thing. I also discovered that superglue has a LOT of other uses: 
 
 --Blacksmiths are now using it to shoe horses 
 --Police investigators use it to bring out latent fingerprints at a crime scene 
 --Military medics sometimes use it to seal some types of wounds, and there's a version sold for veterinary use and another for use by midwives 
 --Attach false eyelashes and fake breasts (not recommended and usually results in a trip to the emergency room) 
 --As a piracy deterrent in early music releases (they send the machine with the cover glued shut) 
 --Electronics designers use it to prototype new devices 
 --As a protective coating when rock climbing and scuba diving 
 --Woodworkers use it for temporary holds and as a varnish for small turned pieces 
 --As a hardener for ballerinas' toe shoes 
 
 So kilnformers are in good company...

 Frit happens. The trick is to make it happen on purpose.
 * * * 
 But there is a more practical piece of trivia that anyone using superglue should know and respect. IF YOU EVER GET ANY ON YOUR FINGERS, THE NEXT THING YOU TOUCH WILL BE ATTACHED FOR A VERY LONG TIME - - SO DON'T SCTRATCH YOUR NOSE (OR ANY PLACE ELSE) !!! 
 
 Been there, done that. 
 
 Superglue comes in a variety of formulations, each with a different 'open' time. This is the time it takes for the glue to set. It ranges from 5 to about 30 seconds. I usually use the fastest, so IF I just happen to get some on my fingers, and IF I just happen to touch my fingers together, ... well you can guess what happens. Believe me, it is no picnic trying to get your fingers apart. 
 
 Typically sold to wood turners (we must be a pretty dumb lot)
  is a vial of magical glue remover. 
  That, along with a few choice (I mean magic) words, 
  and a fancy dance around the garage, you eventually can get your fingers,
   or anythng else you happened to touch, apart. 
 
 Really, it is nothing but fingernail polish remover, or acetone. Works fine. 
 
 Seriously, I had a little fun with this, but this is a much more immediate danger than extremely low levels of cyano by-products.

  An alternative if you want colour with the bubbles is to try Unique Glass colours with their bubble powder, here is the link: 
 http://www.uniqueglasscolors.com/glasoriginalproject.html 
 
 I've used some of the transparent colours with success and the results are very similar to the example on the website quoted in the first post

<h4>Liquid stringer medium and BE 08 powder.</h4>
  
  Liquid stringer medium is a good choice for a liquid medium. <br>
  It can be mixed fairly thick (like clay), <br>
  and will allow actual sculpting of the powder, <br>
  or it can be mixed to thinner consistency for raking. <br>
  It doesn't burn off until about 1350 F. <br>

<h4>Cable pulling gel</h4>

New post  Posted: Thu Jul 26, 2007 11:37 pm  <br>
 
  Go to big box hardware store - Lowe's, Home Depot, 
  and look in the electrical section for cable pulling (liquid gel) stuff.
   It's about $8.00 but you only need a bit, so it will last for a long time. 
 Cheapest and best mixer with powders that I have found. Doesn't contaminate,
  no algae growth, suspends the stirred mixture ,
  gives a bit of grab with the thick liquid. <br>
 
 Someone else suggested this a while back, 
 but I am a confirmed believer in this mixture for powder. <br>
<a name="freeze-n-fry"> <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Freeze and Fry </h3></a>

SO. What if you froze a piece 
 and then *buried* it in a tub (Stainless or ceramic) full of a 
 sand/silica flour/kiln wash mix. If you really packed the powder 
 around it, it would support the piece until it starts to fuse, after which it 
 would hold together by itself. I think that this might be a way 
 to get more spindly pieces. You'd have to clean the piece 
 up afterwards, but that is nothing new to PDV artists. 
 
 (By the way, this is how faience articles are glazed 
 using the cementation technique, so there is some precedent 
 here) 
 
 Of course, you could go one better and *paint the frozen piece 
 with Hydroperm*. Then invert it and voila: you have a 
 refractory mold formed from the glass rather than the other way 
 round! I know it sounds weird. What would be the benefit? 
 
 Several things: 
 You would know what colors you have before it goes in the kiln. 
 Having an investment layer around the piece, you would be 
 free to go to higher temperatures with no fear of slumping. 
 You would be less likely to get bubbles in the investment. 
 You would still be able to produce a piece with much less effort. 
 
 Just a crazy thought...

  I've been working with a slightly different method since before the turn of the century...the current one! Method & century. If you mix the powder with a liquid binder instead of water (I use a non toxic, seaweed binder; you might like cmc), let it come to room temp after freezing it, & popping it out of a mold; let it dry completely & then you can use an emory board to 'cold work' it ahead of firing it. You can carve additional designs into it. It doesn't crumble. Some binders are harder & more difficult to carve than others & some binders won't let you carve into it without it crumbling.

  Let it sit on the kiln shelf undisturbed for about an hour before firing. The water "evaporates" but leaves the piece held together anyway. Then fire.

Freeze'n'fire
Here are a couple of tips for working with flexible molds and frozen frit: 
 
 1. We use powder and find that it fuses at lower temperatures and with a 
 better surface finish than the bigger frit. We do use bigger frit in the 
 interior of pieces, though. The finer the frit on the surface of your piece, 
 the better it will come out (assuming you want a shiny surface). We have 
 even tried grinding our own extra fine powder (in a rock tumbler) and 
 adding FuseMaster enamels to the regular powders. Both of these gave 
 really great results. 
 
 2. The key to getting this to work is to make sure that the glass paste is 
 really tamped down in the mold. That way your piece holds together 
 even after it dries out and it won't crumble around the edges. 
 
 What we do is vibrate the mold while adding the glass paste. You can do 
 this easily just by tapping the mold with the edge of a palette knife. The 
 glass slurry settles down and the water rises to the surface. Blot it off with 
 a flat piece of tissue or paper towel. Now tap some more. Don't be too 
 gentle! You really want the glass to settle in. Phil Teefy uses one of those 
 vibrating back thumpers on the table to vibrate his molds. Keep tapping 
 and blotting until you don't get a sheen on top when you tap the mold. 
 This means you have *just enough* water left in the glass to hold it 
 together. 
 
 
 3. Since plastic and rubber molds naturally repel water, we used to have a 
 lot of trouble with bubbles getting caught in the mold, particularly in things 
 like the points of a shell. Then Raphael Schnepf told us about something 
 called Kodak Photo-Flo. It's a wetting agent that is used by 
 photographers. We mix a few drops with the water before we add the 
 glass powder, and it just works like a charm. We put it in the water first, 
 then pour the dry powder or frit into the water. This way the bubbles 
 never get into the slurry in the first place, and the slurry flows beautifully 
 into the molds. 
 
 4. After you have frozen your pieces, they are surprisingly durable as 
 long as they stay frozen. I have dropped pieces on the floor, picked 
 them up and put them in the kiln and they came out just fine. 
 
 However, if you do break one while it is frozen, we have not found any 
 way to put it back together. You just can't push it close enough together 
 to fix the break. You're better off just thawing it out and mixing it up 
 again. 
 
 5. This is really important. Put your piece on a warm primed kiln shelf 
 and let it dry for *at least* an hour before firing. We let our good stuff dry 
 overnight. As it dries it will become quite fragile, so don't try to move it 
 around after it thaws. 
 
 Why do this? Because you want the water in the piece to melt and soak 
 into the kiln shelf. This sucks the piece tighter together and pulls the fine 
 particles down into the surface of the piece. If you don't do this, and fire 
 right away, the water in the piece turns to steam and goes out through the 
 top of the piece. No, it won't explode, but this carries fine particles out to 
 the surface and results in a cloudy layer particularly in the convex parts of 
 the design. At least, that's my theory. 
 
 I found this out totally by accident. I was really pulling my hair out over 
 the cloudiness and was doing a gazillion tests. Nothing was working and I 
 was losing a lot of sleep. One night about 3 AM I pulled a critter out of the 
 freezer and popped it on the kiln shelf. I was going to fire it, but fell 
 asleep on the sofa by mistake. 12 hours later, refreshed, I fired the piece 
 and it came out PERFECT. 
 
 6. Pieces do shrink about 15% in all directions. We use the HotLine 
 Primo Primer since it has less "tooth" than the other primers and 
 lets our pieces shrink uniformly without sticking to the shelf. 
 
 7. One of the coolest things about this technique is that you can get 
 AMAZINGLY thin sections. We make pieces that are 1/16" thick and 
 yet have full 3D detail. You can make leaves and flowers and then 
 tack them onto plates, tiles, etc. 
 
 8. Since the pieces do shrink, fire them first, before you tack fuse them onto 
 other solid glass pieces. If you try to put a thick frozen frit piece onto a 
 piece of plain glass and fuse it all together, it warps something awful. 
 
 9. The bigger the piece, the slower you have to ramp it as you get up to 
 the fusing temperature. For pieces made with COE 90 powder, this 
 temperature is between 1275 and 1300 degrees F. For little pieces you 
 can ramp at 600 degrees/hour right up to 1300 and hold for 20 minutes. 
 For big pieces you will want to creep up at maybe 50 degrees per hour 
 after you pass 1200. Coming down the glass is a solid mass and 
 you should anneal as appropriate for the size of the piece. 
 
 Ideally, all the glass in the piece reaches the critical temperature at the 
 same time. It's really a wierd thing to watch.. When the piece starts to 
 fuse, it just happens all at once. You can actually watch it shrinking before 
 your eyes, and the interior starts to glow. (Please use IR eye protection if 
 you like to watch. You don't want to get cataracts!). 
 
 Also, the bigger the piece, the lower the temperature at which you should 
 fuse it, to avoid slumping. Phil Teefy fuses his boxes and bowls at about 
 1275, I think. He'll also be in Las Vegas; you might want to ask him. 
 
 10. This is so totally FUN, and it is a great technique for kids. After the 
 glass powder is mixed with water, it is as totally safe as a craft can get, 
 and there is no binder to burn out or anything. For the upcoming show, we 
 made hundreds of Glow Bunnies. I'm never happier than when tapping a 
 big candy mold full of critters. Razz 
 
 I Hope this helps!

  Charles I find it hard to control my hands so I had to find another way (besides building molds, pouring wax..plaster...etc) to get 3-d objects into some of my glass. I found that using a two part silicone type mold making substance I could make flexible molds of just about anything I wanted. You can get this stuff at most jewelry supply places. Things like shells, ceramic flowers, marbles, etc. came out with incredible detail in this substance. 
 I then mix powdered frit with water and "paint" it into the mold, mixing colors as needed. Blot the excess water out and freeze. When frozen, unmold and then they go into a kiln and heated to around 1300 degrees for 90 COE glass. I have since found out there is a guy doing classes and even a web site with frozen frit. I don't want to cut into his business so I will just give you the basics and you can play with it like I did or look him up. I was amazed they didn't fall apart upon heating but they hold all the great detail they had in the mold. 
 
 I have been doing this for around a year now and was told last week about this site...I ordered some of his stuff but I just got it and will see if it improves my methods later.

 thank you for your answer ! <br>
 I am from germany and my english skills are not good so it is difficult <br>
 for me to watch a lot of discussions, but i try to learn this. <br>
 <p>
 Here are the additional informations. <br>
 the schedule: <br>
 1. 20°C/h until 150°C, holding 360 min (evaporate the water) <br>
 2. 20°C/h until 180°C, holding 360 min (evaporate the chemical bound water) <br>
 3. 50°C/h until 600°C, holding 120 min (curing the mold und burn the wax residues out) <br>
 4. 150°C/h until 900°C, holding 180 min (to meld the cullet in the flower pot and let the glass flow into the molds) <br>
 5. as fast as possible until 532°C, holding 300min (to avoid devitrification and anneal the transparent bullseye glass <br>
 6.10°C/h until 501°C, holding 300 min (annealing of the opaque bullseye glass) <br>
 7. 10°C/h until 472°C, holding 150 min (annealing of the gold purple bullseye glass) <br>
 8. 10°C/h until 350°C <br>
 9. as slow as the oven do until room temperature <br>
* * * * <br>
Helga,<br> 
 
 One other thing you might want to check out. <br>
 Is the mold empty and being fed fom the flower pot, <br>
 or do you put frit in the mold? Reason I am asking is, <br>
 I've done flower pot experiments with cold honey. <br>
 Honey placed in a refrigerator for about an hour is more like the 
 viscosity of glass. <br> Plus, you can see bubbles in there, <br>
 and you can eat the experiment afterwards. <br>
 
 If there is a bubble in the honey in the flower pot, <br>
 it will trail down into the mold. It's called "bubble entrainment". <br>
 I've had mystery voids like yours. <br>
 They only occured with flower pot feeds. 
 <br>
 If I put frit in the mold, even with a flower pot feed for extra glass, <br>
 the mystery bubbles disappeared. Something else to consider. <br>
  
 Your hypothesis about colorants accelerating gypsum degradation <
 can be easily checked. <br>
 Completely encase a bubble-free piece of sheet color glass in mold material and fire. You should either see a bubble where none can exist, or you won't. Simple.

  The reaction of darker colored glass ( like cobalt blue and emerald green) with the investment is what I've said for years, causes cavitation. And that's with leaded crystal. With soda-lime glass, the problem is even worse. Even the clear soda-lime can get "set-off". Its very hard to get cavitation with clear leaded crystal. 
 
 But this reaction does not cause "bubbles", per se (see below). I've had plenty of castings with very little bubble and lots of cavitation. The reaction develops between the glass and the investment and causes a gas pocket to develop between the cooling glass and the investment and pushes the glass away from the investment wall, so the glass cannot fill the investment form properly. And as the glass gets near softening point, on the way down, the "cavitation gas" can keep the glass away from the investment until the glass starts to solidify, and leave the reminder of this reaction in the glass. Its always ugly. 
 
 On large pieces you will never get cavitation down low on the form. Cavitation will occur where this gas reaction can overcome the weight of the glass. On smaller forms this could occur almost anywhere. But for the most part, as a rule of thumb, cavitation will occur on the upper portions of the casting, and it likes it near the sprue, where there is the least amount of pressure to overcome from the glass (hydrostatic pressure). 
 
 But even if you cast the same piece, same color, same way, with a piece prone to cavitation, you would get cavitation in different areas of the different castings each time. I attribute this to the fact of the "cavitating reaction" flaring up in some spot, then gradually dying off, and a new reaction flaring up someplace else, and on and on. You will never get the same cavitation problem in the same place in the same way. Its unpredictable in that way. I've cast the same piece with the same colors and same investment and same schedules, and it was a real puzzler to me dealing with the unpredictability of placement, for a while. 
 
 The cavitation hold at 50F above softening point, on the way down, holds the glass at a slightly molten state until this "cavitating reaction" slows down greatly or stops, so that the glass can finally fill the mold successfully. That's my theory and it works to get cavitation free (or nearly free) cast glass. 
 
 I will say the chilling effect of the sprue can accentuate cavitation in soda-lime glass, thus especially for soda-lime castings, I would cover the feed sprue with some type of insulation like fiber ceramics. It will help. 
 
 Don't look for something that looks like "bubbles" as evidence of cavitation. Could this reaction between the glass and the investment cause bubbles when the glass is more liquid. Who knows? How can you tell? Put a tiny gas-o-meter probe into the bubble and see if it contains atmosphere or cavitation gas? But the ugly depressions, the gashes on the surface of the glass, that's what you have to grind out later. From a glass casting point of view, that's what you want to control or get rid of. 
 A few bubbles under the surface? Eh, what's the worry?
