Re: Cerium Impregnated Pads for Glass, Stone and Ceramic

Oh yes. Head over to HIS and look at the diamond sponges (they call them handipads). They have cerium and polishing sponges as well, they're not very expensive, and I pretty much swear by them. I start with the diamond sponges for cutting, move up through the grits, and at some point switch over to wet-dry sand paper to get the glass to a satin gloss. Then I hit it with the smoothing sponges and finally the cerium if I want a really high gloss. To tell the truth, I don't usually NEED the cerium--it's glossy by the last smoothing sponge.

I find, at least as far as handworking is concerned, that you use the flexible sponges if you want to preserve the profile of your piece. You use the stiff sponges when you want to knock off the high spots and get everything to the same height (or you put some grit on a piece of glass, add water and grind it that way). 

I think most kilnformers prefer the rigid coldworking tools because they are looking for flat, even surfaces. But since I'm primarily working with sculpted pieces that, by definition, need to keep their detail, the sponges are a far better bet. Even when I'm coldworking with power equipment, I only use a rigid grinding surface if I'm squaring something off--otherwise my abrasives are heavily padded.
