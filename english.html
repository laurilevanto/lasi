<h2>About this site.</h2>
At the end of 2006 there was no good book of fusing in Finnish.
Learning it had been a hard job. I had a feeling that there is no point
to take all I have learned with me when the time comes.
<p/>
I was asked to write a book. I preferred to make it a Web site.
If it had been a book it would never come out. The task continues.
The number of unwritten pages grows faster than thenumber of written pages.
I have done my best to check the information, 
but the responsibility is on the reader.
<p/>
Last year, 2010, these pages were visited 13826 times. 
Surprisingly there has been visits from over 50 countries, 
although only few of the 300+ pages are in English.
In the December someone in Thailand worked through
 57 pages at one session.
<p/>

The glassists are a world wide community.
 If someone has translated  some of my pages into her/his native language, 
 I would gladly provide space for those.
 <p/>
 There is a section for 
<a href="http://lauri.lsd.dk/lasi/polku/kysymys.php">
 Questions and answers</a> 
. It is in Finnish, but questions
 in English, German and Scandinavian languages
  (not sure about Islandic and Färöya!) 
 are welcome.
 My E-mail address is on the front page.
 You will get an E-mail answer in some understandable language.

 There are plenty of good texts about fusing elsewhere. I recommend those.
 Some of my pages contain   interesting but hard to find information. 
 Those I have made bi-lingual or translated into English.
