Check out Laurie Spray's pot melt tutorial. Her schedule for flattening melts is:
100dph to 1100
50dph to 1250 hold 45 min
250dph to 1460 (or full fuse)
9999 to 900 hold 3 hours
100dph to 800 hold 1 hour
100dph to 700 hold 15 min. (this is for COE 90)

Her schedule is much slower than the one you used. It's always been successful for me.

Too bad that one broke...looks like a pretty melt.
