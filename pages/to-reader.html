<h2>To The Reader</h2>
<p>
When I started glass fusing there were no introductory texts in Finnish.
I collected information from many sources
 especially from http://www.warmglass.com/.
Soon I relized that I have to sort my notes. That's how these pages started.
The Finnish section has some 350+ pages.
I added some material that I compilwed from different sources. Those pages
I wrote in English, too. The English section got rapidlyan own audience.
Now I am enlarging the English section.

While I add new pages, also old pages get modified. In the table of contents 
the latest midification date is given for each page.<br>
Major changes are listed in the "what is New" section.
</p>
<p>
The Finnish section begins with an Introductory Tour.
 For English speaking readers I recommend
 http://www.warmglass.com/basic.htm to begin with.
