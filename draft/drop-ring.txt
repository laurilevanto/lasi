We've been playing with the drop-formed vessel for some time now in the studio, and wanted to show some of the results. The large vessels are 10" and 15" in diameter at the top rim, and about 15" tall. The smaller ones are about 6" in diameter, and about as tall. All Bullseye Glass.

As I remember it was just under 3/4 inch thick........they are all quite sturdy.

Very nice, Judith,
seems very challenging technically.... [15" drop???, that's deep!]

And Cate, we "just" score and break the rim off. If the glass is properly annealed ut really isn't difficult...just takes a bit of nerve the first time.
