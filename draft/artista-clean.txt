Which side is the top?
  
In the end, the question of which side is of preference is completely unimportant when using ARTISTA

. 
Experience shows that one can no longer recognize which side contained the fine structure, following smelting.
Also with respect to bubbling that could possibly occur between the base glass and the application, the effect of
the plane structure is more a matter of speculation than a measurable quantity.
The number and size of bubbles primarily depends on the size of the area covered and how the temperature is
controlled during smelting. 
  
Cloudiness occurs anyway?
  
If surface cloudiness results during the use of ARTISTA

, from experience the reasons for this can usually be 
found in either failure to clean or insufficient cleaning before the smelting process begins.
  
Cleaning is essential!
  
To prevent slight scratches from being caused by the rollers in the drawing machine, a small dose of sulfur 
dioxide is applied to the still viscous glass near the ceramic nozzle. (See photo).
An extremely thin protective film results, the so-called sulphate bloom. When one rubs a finger over a sheet of
raw glass just after it has been delivered, a small amount of white powder accumulates. 
This substance can only be removed using cleaning agents that contain a substantial amount of water. Pure ethyl 
alcohol leaves hazy streaks that become visible following smeltin
