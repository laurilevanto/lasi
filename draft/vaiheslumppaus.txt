Hi Lauri:

I am beginning fusing, and am reading through the Newcomer archives in order to pick up as much knowledge as I can. I ran across your response to Becky today. You say, "... fill with luto half the mould ..." Can you explain what you mean by that? I have some molds that look like hers, and would like to avoid the same problems she had!

Also, are you saying that you do multiple slump firings?

Thanks!

You have it right David,
I do multiple slumps, so the glass is sagged stepwise.
When I have a difficult mould,
I fill it partly with some refractory.
Dry plaster is good, but I usually do it with luto.
Luto is once fired mold material that I grind to powder..

Wen a deep but difficult mould is partly filled,
The glass is supported in the center and does not pull
the edges so much.

The next step is with less filler. When a partially slumped
piece is reslumped, it gas already formed at edges,
and these have a better friction to mould walls.
So it sags only in the middle.

This is not often needed. Most pieces I succeed to slump
in one stage.
