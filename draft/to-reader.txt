To the reader

when I started tehre were no good books about fusing.
I had to pick information bitwise. Thnen was time to sort my notes and so the Finnish edeition was begun. If i had tried to write abook, it would never come out. The material is still developing and growing. There are about 300 chapters now ( Sep 2011).

Some pqages I wrote in English, to thank those that have helped me. They got an audience, so now I am enlarging  the English section.
