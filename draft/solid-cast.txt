 When the glass cools below softening point it forms a "skin"
that is no longer capable of contracting, while the interior is
more viscose and contracting. As the interior volume decreases, there is a pressure difference of both sides of the skin.
While the skin no longer can contract, it must dent in.
That is cavitation in my understanding.

The ointment is like Hugh said, to soak a bit over softening point so long most heat from the interior has escaped.

 :? I have spoken about suckers before in a post probably last year. A sucker as I call it is sometimes evident in cast glass, it is where the glass has a dimple and the dimple has the texture of the mold in it and not polished like a bubble. 
My theory is that as the glass is cooling down in the mold the outside (glass closest to mold) of the glass cools first and as the center of the glass cools it has to shrink so it selects where the hottest part of the mold is (and glass) and sucks in the surface causing a dimple. 
This dimple can happen on any thickness of cast glass but only on a 3D forms where the opening of the mold is small. 
At the opening of the mold I notice always the glass has a concave surface this is why I think that the suckers are caused by shrinkage of the glass. 
 
So please do tell what yur theory is Hugh I am very curious.

Sometimes when concavely slumping glass that has been fused against a flat surface investment I find that the surface wrinkles (crinkles?). After studying many examples I've come to the conclusion that glass in contact with investment loses flux by absorbtion into the investment matrix. After cooling there is less flux in the glass skin that was right at the investment interface. That glass skin is now slightly more refractory, and less conformable. When slumped the skin does not move as readily as the substrate and it wrinkles in concave slumps. In convex slumps the glass surface breaks up into a lacy pattern. The change in composition is not enough to produce annealing problems. 
 
The fluxes (sodium and/or lead) in glass at fusing temperatures are extremely reactive and "fume" out of the glass to affect nearby materials. You can see the effect on the tile below. It's clear glass with a thin glaze of brown glass that was made more refractory to produce a semi-matt surface. The red pattern is done with blowing color - quite fluxy. At temperature, flux from the blowing color has migrated out into the brown glass and stained it. The distance between the arrow tips is 8mm, well over 1/4 inch. That's how far flux can migrate in air - I'm not suggesting that it could migrate as much into investment but I think the distance would be significant. 
 
I've seen wrinkles (crinkles) on glass that has not been slumped but simply melted close to absorbent refractories. With a less fluxy glass skin, different cooling behaviors may produce crinkles.

Sorry to beat a dead horse, but let me see if can sum up what I've read here about kinds of gaps occurring during casting: 
 
Cavitation:  
Depressions in a casting most likely caused by a chemical reaction between outgasses in the investment and colorants in the glass. 
Action: Expanding gas "blister" displaces equivalent volume of glass. 
Appareance: Characterized by rough edges (degree of roughness increasing with area/depth of cavity) and smooth or glossy centers. (Logically then, wouldn't cavitation be worst where the investment was the thickest and there was the greatest opportunity for outgassing?) 
Preventative: Extend hold time 50 degrees above softening point of glass to deplete iinvestment outgassing and allow glass to flow back into space. May be difficult with larger volumes of investment. 
 
"Suckies:" Depressions in a casting most likely caused by warping and inward flexing of investment in thin spots. 
Action: Investment warps where the mold is thinnest or weakest, displacing glass. Degree of warpage varies with mold composition, can increase with increasing percentages of plaster. 
Appearance: Smooth, softly curving, wave-like depressions in the surface of the casting, location corresponding to thin spots in mold. 
Preventative: Strengthen or rigidize thinnest areas of mold prior to firing. 
 
Bubble: Holes on or near the surface of the glass. 
Action: Air trapped in glass rising to rest against an investment surface. 
Appearance: Normally spherical/circular, characterized by smooth, round, sharp edges. 
Preventative: Create vents in mold in areas most likely to trap bubbles. Hold glass above softening point and at peak firing temperatures long enough to allow trapped air to escape. Keep firing temps as low as possible to avoid causing additional reactions with investment. 
 
Block mold: Casting investment that takes the shape of its container, usually with great variability in wall thickness. 
 
Investment shell: Investment mold that follows the shape of its model, giving uniform thickness to mold walls throughout the piece. 
 
Feel free to add/correct/change as you see fit. I just want to see if I can sum up key points in the thread as briefly as possible... 
 
If I understand you, Hugh, you're saying that the thin spots in the investment shell are flexing inward when the rigid outer shells of the mold prevent the investment shell from flexing out? That would imply that the investment is expanding and, with no where else to go, moves into the glass. What happens when there is no rigid outer shell? Seems to me the direction of expansion would depend on the shape, the weight above the thin area, the weight of the glass pressing against the investment, etc. 
 
Or am I just not getting it? 
 
Thanks--

Ellen, my suggestion to continue to solve your cavitation problem is to add some crystalbolite to your investment mix and go for longer hold times at 1250 to give this chemical reaction time to fizzle out completely. Don't get hung up on the 8 hour suggestion. I had to go 16 hours on some designs and colors, and that was with leaded crystal. Not what is appearing to me as more cavitation prone soda-lime. The addition of crystalbolite will 
shorten the amount of hold time at 1250.

In the temperature range of 570-580C the COE for Bullseye is approximately 502.

A COE without reference to a temperature range is meaningless.

Hugh - could you plug Lani's figure back into your math so we could see how much the glass itself is expanding or shrinking in the range near the annealing point independent of the shell material? I see in Wikipedia that the ratio of linear to volumetric expansion is approximately 1/3, so 502 * 3 = ~1500, which seems like it might be significant. Glass COE as listed is conventionally linear, right? So using your example of 144 cu. in., a volumetric COE of 1500 over a 10 degree range between Lani's 570 to 580 C, I get: 
 
(144 cu. in.) * (1500 COE * 1 x 10e-6) * (10 deg. C) = 2.16 cu. in. 
 
That's just for 10 degrees, but in a complex mold shape there's likely to be larger temperature ranges between hot areas of larger glass volume, and extended narrower areas of smaller volume that are in the process of freezing in the mold. So a mold 1/10th the volume of your example would come in closer to your 1/4" cube of shrinking volume. Or am *I* off by a factor of 10? Otherwise this seems like a significant amount of shrinkage, easily responsible for the classic aluminum-like suckies as seen in the images posted earlier in this thread.

Let me start out saying that if this gets to a tenth page . . . take the last word . . . please. 
In Henry Halem's book, he succinctly laid out what we all want in a mold. 
Here it is: 
1. Not shrink,crack, warp, or deteriorate when subjected to high heat (1500Â° F) (815Â° C) [or higher]. 
2. Retain detail throughout the length of casting. 
3. Have a similar expansion to the glass being used. 
4. Clean easily from the glass surface after casting. 
That has always been my baseline. Circumstances have forced me to add a couple of my own. 
Easy to use. I don't want to become an expert moldmaker. Just good enough is fine. 
Easy to get. I want a consistant supply of materials that doesn't require me to plan purchases in advance or warehouse large quantities. 
Cheap. I don't want the cost of materials to impede trying out any hare-brained idea that comes into my head. 
I use 1 part hydrocal/2 parts silica. 1 part water/2 parts dry. I started using this when I found out that hydrocal was the most common plaster there was. I should add that when the last big aluminum manufacturer closed then easily obtainable aluminum casting products ceased to exist here. You're lucky that they're still in the NW. 
I got this out of a book from a guy that worked in some science capacity at Corning. He said it ought to work and I decided that if it did indeed work then any problems related to it were entirely mine. Once I got over blaming the material then I found that not only did it work but that it was very versatile. I use it for anything including cores. Alas, it too is not the grail. It has to be used certain ways and unfortunately some of those ways cause the mold to grow to unwieldy proportions. 
Alright thats about as long as I can blather.

For a hundred C drop in the kiln (say from ~ 1300F to 1120F which may be the range that cavitation forms), the glass shrinks as follows:

= [(1-((500E-7)*100)^3] – 1 = 1.5 E-2 or 1.5%

#2. Talking directly to the manufacturers at Gaffer's, they told me that when they have observed the surface of large, deep open faced castings they have visually seen the glass go through a contraction stage at around 1050F, or about 50F below softening point. I believe the breaking point of the glass is actually closer to this temp than at 1100F, the official softening point of Gaffer's.

I could tighten up the "Red Zone" to being around 1050F for Gaffer's and probably around 1150F for soda-limes. But I don't want to do that. I'm not trying to pin down the exact temp. Just being close is good enough for successful glass casting.

A typical curing schedule for my investments are:
100 to 200F dph to 300F, hold 6 to 18 hrs (depends on thickness of investment)
25-50F dph to 400F/200C hold 2 to 6 hrs (depending on investment)
