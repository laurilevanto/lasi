I agree with Steve: Instead, the big deal is to understand what's happening at every stage of a firing, and use that to plan the right schedule. If you set a goal for each segment of the schedule--"heat the glass without breaking it," "have the glass sag gently and evenly, starting in the middle and slowly moving out, pushing air ahead"--it gets much easier to figure out time and temp. That's one reason that pre-programmed controllers and that daggone schedule planning software are so dangerous--they make newcomers think there's no need to customize a schedule.
